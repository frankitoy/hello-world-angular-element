# HelloWorldAngularElement

Just trying out how angular web components handle routing on it's own.

Run `npm i` to install local project dependencies

Run `npm i -g live-server`

Run `./build.sh` to compile the angular element, once completed run `live-server preview`

Then go to your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
